          Hello, It's me Bishal Joshi. I'm a student of Computer Engineering.
          My home town is Dhangadi. I'm currently living in Kathmandu.
          I like to play go on adventures, meet new peoples and connect with them.
          I have travelled most of the eastern and western part of Nepal 
          and a bit of central part. I have been to most of the hilly and terai areas only.
          I havent been to mountains till today (8/30/2022). I will plan a schedule for my trip to mountains soon.
          My favourite place to hang out or to stay in chill is pokhara. It is really a beautiful and chill kinda place.
          Other than that the places to rome and feel the nature is far-western's hilly region
          Like Dadeldhura, Silgadi, Dipayal etc. The people living that area are so friendly and kind hearted. I feel like home
          whenever I go there. To explore more Ilam is the place with beautiful and peaceful environment.
          The vibe in Ilam is different then on other places of Nepal due to its geographic structure and
          beautiful tea gardens in every hills.I plan to visit every part of Nepal someday.
        <br><br>
        
          My favourite outdoor sport is Swimming. I like to play Swimming alot. 
          I played Swimming from my school level. I was in class 5 I started Swimming.
          Beside Swimming I like to play Table-Tennis and Football. My favourite football club is
          Chelsea. But my favourite sport 
          is Swimming because Im best at it. My hatest sport is Cricket because I dont know how to play
          Cricket. Though I sometimes watch and enjoy IPL.
          <br><br>
        
          Sometimes I like to do photography of Nature too. Whenever I visit any natural beauty
          places I click the pictures and save them in my gallery. I like to talk to people from different
          places and want to know about their culture, tradition and mainly about themselves how they live.
          I like to learn good things about them and mainly I like to learn about different lifestyle
          about peoples from different places. 
          <br><br>
          
          I started my schooling from International Public H.S. School, which is located in Mahendranagar. I studied till class 4 there. 
          Then I came to kathmandu to continue my futher studies from class 5.
          My second school was Ideal English H.S School which is located in Chabahil, Kathmandu. I gave my SLC 
          from Ideal English H.S. School. This School was the best school I could ever get. This school boosted up my leading skills,
          taught me many things. Not only in studies but Ideal taught me to be best in extracurricular activities too. 
          The principle Sir of Ideal English H.S School used to encourage students to be good in extracurricular activities
          beside studies. Then I countinued my higher studies from Prasadi Academy (+2). This college taught me the most important
          factor of life, that is value of time, value of 
          studies, decision making and the main important thing I learned from this college was discipline.
          Then I continued my bachelor from NCIT(Nepal College Of Information and Technology). Here I'm the things that will be benificial
          for my career. Not only studies related things like programming, Designing, Inventing, here I'm learning about the most valueable question
          of my career: What is engineering?. The studies related things like : Software languages, Assembly languages, Hardwares, Softwares,
          Robotics, AI, Machine Learning, Image Processing, Big Data, Database, Servers , Data Communication ,these all are studies related terms which
          I gained knowledge about. But not only the programming related things are taught here, here I learned about many company terms , managing skills,
          what it takes to do a startup in a more efficient way, how are the company learned? , how are we suppose to talk with peoples.
          I even learned about politics , what is good politics and bad? how to impress people? how share ideas , how to get people to follow your ideas
          and path. Many career related things , I learned Here.
          Now I cant wait to see my future holds, What are the things, experience I will get to learn in the future.
